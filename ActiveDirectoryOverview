Active Directory is a directory that is developed by Microsoft to manage Windows domain environment. It stores information related to objects such as Computers, Users etc. 
(Phone book for Windows) It performs authentication using Kerberos tickets. Non-Windows devices can perform authentication process through RADIUS or LDAP.

Active Directory is one of the most commonly used identity management service. In this type of assessment, I generally focus on abusing features, trusts, misconfigurations,
components and more.

Physical Active Directory Components
1) Domain Controllers
A DC is a server with the AD DS server role installed that has specifically been promoted to a domain controller. DCs host a copy of the AD DS directory store, provide
authentication and authorization services, replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest, allow administrative access to manage user accounts and 
network resources.

2) AD DS Data Store
The AD DS Data Store contains the database files and processes that store and manage directory information for users, services and applications. It consists of the Ntds.dit
file. It is stored by default in the %SystemRoot%\NTDS on all domain controllers. It is only accessible only through DC processes and protocols.
